    <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language that was initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. It was
        originally named Mocha, then briefly called LiveScript before settling on JavaScript. The language was designed
        to add interactivity to web pages in Netscape Navigator, one of the earliest web browsers.</p>
    <h1>What is JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language used primarily for creating dynamic and interactive content on
        web pages. It allows developers to add functionality to websites, such as validating forms, creating animations,
        handling user interactions, and fetching data from servers without reloading the page. JavaScript is supported
        by all modern web browsers and has also gained popularity for building server-side applications using platforms
        like Node.js. Its syntax is similar to other programming languages like Java and C, making it relatively easy to
        learn for those familiar with programming concepts.
